## R Bootcamp Slides

Some very basic introductory material on R and RStudio. 

Slides were developed using code adapted from Max Kuhn, Alison Hill, Jennifer Bryan, and Jim Hester.

Material was taken and adapted from several sources (see slides).

Data were taken from Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robins' (Causal Inference book)[https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/]
